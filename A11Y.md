Accessibility was a key part of our design process.

We did this by firstly by making some components to  be keyboard friendly. For example, ability to use TAB to switch within form fields, as well as being able to use ENTER to submit some forms instead of just the on mouse click. 

- Images were added ALT labels.
- Attempted to add arialabels / labels to fields so browsers can detect the type of input field.
