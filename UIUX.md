The webiste was designed to be coherent and easy to use 
for someone, with easy transitions and colour choices.

This was done through:
- Having a black background on all admin pages, with white components to contrast and make it visually easy to distinguish the important elements.
- Action Buttons were given our primary colour, the gradient which changes on hover to signify an action that the user could take. For example, creating a new quiz or getting to the results page.
- On the other hand, we choose a dark colour for secondary actions such as 'close', 'No', 'back', and 'logout' buttons.
- A grid layout was chosen to make it easier to follow for quizzes and for questions. 

Furthermore, the UI/UX was tested with example use cases to verify that a user would have acess to all neseccary actions. For example, the path from logging in to creating a game and then playing it was made easy and obvious to follow.
